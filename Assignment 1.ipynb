        "During this assignment, my goals was to establish an application in order to help healthcare professional and clients predict the likelihood of heart risk based on demographic data, lifestyle, and health metric factors. At the beginning, I developed a plan to collect user data using function “def get_user_input()” such as height and weight to compute the BMI calculation, using function “calculate_bmi(height, weight)” with: BMI = weight / (height *2), and collect their Smoking status, Drinking status, and Physical Activity Status.  After compute BMI, clients will be classified into different categories based on their bmi data by function “def get_bmi_category(bmi)”, for example bmi < 18.5 is “Underweight”, 18.5<= bmi <25 is “Normal”, 25 < bmi <=30 is “Overweight”, and the other is “Obesity”.  Then, this information will be assessed with all possible outcomes in the heart prediction risk table data. If user data match with available data in heart prediction risk table using “def predict_heart_risk(bmi_category, smoking, alcohol, activity)”, the result will determine the heart risk condition of the user that match with heart prediction risk table, whilst returning “unknown”. In this step, “pandas” and “csv” were used to stored user information into a csv file for analysing. Lastly user input will convert into visualizations using  “matplotlib.pyplot” to visualize the correlation between user bmi categories and lifestyle factors affecting heart risk prediction.\n",

        "It can be denied a huge benefit of AI in learning coding in pre-class, in-class and post-class activities. To complete this task, I mainly used Colab AI as the source of generating data.  There are numerous advantages that AI can bring to programming field such as providing instant explanations, for example whenever dealing with new syntax concept, AI provides a clear and detailed explanation of the meaning of that syntax or concept, therefore, I can understand the function of that syntax and easily apply for future use. Most importantly, it can generate code snippets based on my prompts or problems. For instance, I need to get bmi category based on the user’s bmi calculation or  match the user data with provided heart prediction risk table, Colab AI generates code snippers and from that it saves me a lot of time while still understand the underlying logic. However, from my personal experience, the role of human instructors cannot be replaced by technology.  Under learning perspectives, AI can help to provide code but there are not always the most efficient and effective solutions for the problems. I believe that with the knowledge and experience throughout many years, the instructor can provide the most detailed and creative way that specifically addresses the issues that learner might have. Moreover, another critical limitation of AI is they cannot offer feedback or personalized guidance, which really important for every learner. Nonetheless, with the assistance of instructors and the help of AI, my assignment has improved in many ways. During this assignment, I found that the function of AI is extremely useful whenever I need to explain the meaning of each syntax. For example, I ask AI about the function of “data.append([height, weight, smoking, alcohol, activity,])” , which they offered a detailed description each element in the syntax, how they affect my code, and what they can be used for. In contrast, I have faced several problems when using AI. It can be seen that, AI sometimes cannot fully understand the concept of what I am doing, as a result it may generate invalid syntax for my code. What I have done to solve this issues was to had a look back to all my lecture as well as prompt the questions into the discussion board so that the professor can provide me a clear guidance to address my challenges. Additionally, through documenting GEN AI interactions (prompt, response, effectiveness, modification), I can better utilize the advantages of GEN AI while finding a proper solution for the limitations of this Artificial Intelligence. For example, when prompt AI to modify the code to ask whether user want to continue typing input, AI has effectively generated the code for the issue. However, this code is restrictive in the sense that for 'no', it does not accept n, N, which users might naturally enter. As a result, modification is necessary to check for all the possible input that user might use.\n"
